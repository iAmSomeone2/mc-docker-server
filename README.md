# mc-docker-server
A Docker image set up that checks for the latest release minecraft server software on startup, installs any updates, and runs the server.

## WARNING
This repo is absolutely not ready for deployment, yet. The server updater application is still in early development, and the Dockerfile is not properly set up.
